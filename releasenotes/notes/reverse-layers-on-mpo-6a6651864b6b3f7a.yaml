    Fixes the order in which layers are applied to a common MPO state when
    computing the dynamic MPF coefficients. Previously, the layers would be
    applied in the order given, but when acting on an identity MPO and
    contracting with the initial state from the outside, the layers have to be
    reversed to produce the correct result.

    This bug only affected circuits that are not symmetric with respect to layer
    reversal.
