    TeNPy can disable ``Sz`` conservation. Previously, the
    :meth:`~qiskit_addon_mpf.backends.tenpy_tebd.MPOState.initialize_from_lattice`
    method did not support this, but a new keyword argument ``conserve`` has
    been added which allows the disabling of ``Sz`` conservation. The default
    remains to be ``True``.
