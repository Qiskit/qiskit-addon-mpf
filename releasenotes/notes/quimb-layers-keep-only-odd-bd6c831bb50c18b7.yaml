upgrade:
  - |
    The ``keep_only_odd`` attribute of :class:`.quimb_layers.LayerModel` has
    been removed. The internal workings have been refactored to ensure that data
    reported by its ``terms`` attribute (which is inherited from the base class)
    is already taking the ``keep_only_odd`` argument of the
    :meth:`.quimb_layers.LayerModel.from_quantum_circuit` constructor method.
