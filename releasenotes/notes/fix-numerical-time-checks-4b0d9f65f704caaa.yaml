    Fixes the :meth:`.DynamicMPF.evolve` method when providing ``time`` values
    with numerical inaccuracies (e.g. ``time=1.00000001``). Previously this
    could cause the LHS and RHS time evolvers to advance too far.
    The new default accuracy is 8 decimal places, but it may be configured via
    the :attr:`.DynamicMPF.TIME_DECIMALS` value.
