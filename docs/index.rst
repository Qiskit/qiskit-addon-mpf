Qiskit addon: multi-product formulas (MPF)
##########################################

`Qiskit addons <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/addons>`_ are a collection of modular tools for building utility-scale workloads powered by Qiskit.

This package contains the Qiskit addon for multi-product formulas (MPFs).
These can be used to reduce the Trotter error of Hamiltonian dynamics.

This package currently contains the following submodules:

- ``qiskit_addon_mpf.static`` for working with static MPFs [`1-2 <#references>`_].

Documentation
-------------

All documentation is available `here <https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-mpf/>`_.

Installation
------------

We encourage installing this package via ``pip``, when possible:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install 'qiskit-addon-mpf'


For more installation information refer to the `installation instructions <install.rst>`_ in the documentation.

Deprecation Policy
------------------

We follow `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ and are guided by the principles in
`Qiskit's deprecation policy <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/DEPRECATION.md>`_.
We may occasionally make breaking changes in order to improve the user experience.
When possible, we will keep old interfaces and mark them as deprecated, as long as they can co-exist with the
new ones.
Each substantial improvement, breaking change, or deprecation will be documented in the
`release notes <https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-mpf/release-notes.html>`_.
